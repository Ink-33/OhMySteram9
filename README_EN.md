Listen, dude! Did you know? In December 31st, 2021, `CentOS 8` ~~was finished! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰~~
Are you still using `CentOS 8`? Why not update to `CentOS Stream 8`, `Rocky Linux 8` or `AlmaLinux` ?

Wait, `CentOS Stream 9` has already released! There are even `Nodejs16` , `Golang1.17.5`, `kernel5.14` and `glic 2.34` package indexes available!

If you pursue new features and a `dnf` package manager, `CentOS Stream 9` is probably your second best choice! (The first one is still `Fedora`)

Unfortunately my VPS provider doesn't provide `CentOS Stream 9` image, or even `CentOS Stream 8` image, so I have to use the outdated `CentOS 8` image, isn't that bad?  

Don't worry, with the method provided in this article, you can also upgrade to `CentOS Stream 9` on `CentOS 8`, with all your data kept and no need to reinstall system!
